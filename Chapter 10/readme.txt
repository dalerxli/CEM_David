The files in this directory are MATLAB files, as discussed in Chapter 10,
D.B.Davidson, "Computational Electromagnetics for RF and Microwave Engineering", 2ed, in preparation 2009. See the headers in the invididual files for details.

The main files are:

- Static2D, which computes the quasi-TEM mode in boxed microstrip

- Eigen2D, which computes the TE eigenvalues and eigenmodes of 
hollow rectangular waveguide.

The other files in the directory are functions required by the main scripts.
